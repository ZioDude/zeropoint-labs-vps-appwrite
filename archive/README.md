# 📁 Archive Directory

This directory contains files that were moved from the project root during the cleanup process. These files are preserved for reference but are no longer actively used in the production deployment.

## 📂 Contents

### 🔧 Deployment Scripts (Legacy)
Various deployment and setup scripts that were created during development but superseded by the final deployment solution:
- Shell scripts for SSL setup, nginx configuration, and deployment
- Multiple iteration files for testing different approaches
- Troubleshooting and testing scripts

### 📚 Documentation Files (Legacy)
Standalone documentation files that have been consolidated into the main `/docs` structure:
- Individual setup guides
- Troubleshooting documents
- Configuration guides
- Platform-specific documentation

### 🧪 Testing & Development Files
Files used during development and testing phases:
- Test scripts
- Validation tools
- Development utilities
- Debugging aids

## 🗂️ Organization

Files are organized by category:
```
archive/
├── scripts/           # Deployment and setup scripts
├── docs/             # Legacy documentation files
├── testing/          # Test files and utilities
└── configs/          # Configuration templates and examples
```

## ⚠️ Important Note

These files are kept for historical reference and potential future use. They should not be deleted without careful consideration, as they may contain useful patterns, configurations, or solutions that could be needed later.

## 🔄 Recovery

If you need to restore any archived file to the main project:
1. Copy the file from the appropriate archive subdirectory
2. Update any paths or references as needed
3. Test thoroughly before using in production
