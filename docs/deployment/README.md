# üöÄ Deployment Guides

Production deployment documentation for the ZeroPoint Labs analytics platform.

## üìã Deployment Guides

### [üìñ Complete Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
Comprehensive guide for production deployment featuring:
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- SSL/TLS certificate setup with Let's Encrypt
- VPS deployment on Hostinger
- Performance optimization and security

### [‚ö° Quick VPS Deployment](./vps.md)
Simplified VPS deployment guide covering:
- Docker setup and configuration
- Appwrite self-hosted deployment
- Domain configuration and DNS
- Basic security setup

## üê≥ Docker Configuration

### Development
```bash
# Build and run locally
docker build -t zeropoint-labs-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 zeropoint-labs-app
```

### Production with Docker Compose
```bash
# Deploy full stack
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Update deployment
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

## üåê Deployment Options

### 1. VPS Deployment (Recommended)
- **Hostinger VPS** - Cost-effective and reliable
- **DigitalOcean Droplet** - Developer-friendly
- **AWS EC2** - Enterprise-grade
- **Linode** - Performance-focused

### 2. Cloud Platforms
- **Vercel** - Easy Next.js deployment (frontend only)
- **Railway** - Full-stack deployment
- **Render** - Docker-based deployment
- **Fly.io** - Edge deployment

### 3. Self-Hosted
- Local server deployment
- Home lab setup
- Corporate infrastructure

## üîß Production Requirements

### Server Specifications
- **Minimum**: 1 CPU, 1GB RAM, 10GB storage
- **Recommended**: 2 CPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB storage
- **High Traffic**: 4+ CPU, 4GB+ RAM, 50GB+ storage

### Software Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04+ (recommended)
- **Docker**: 20.10+
- **Docker Compose**: 2.0+
- **Nginx**: 1.18+ (for reverse proxy)
- **Certbot**: For SSL certificates

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### SSL/TLS Configuration
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
- HTTP to HTTPS redirection
- Strong SSL configuration
- Certificate auto-renewal

### Firewall Setup
```bash
# Basic UFW configuration
ufw allow 22      # SSH
ufw allow 80      # HTTP
ufw allow 443     # HTTPS
ufw enable
```

### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Nginx Configuration
- Gzip compression
- Static file caching
- Rate limiting
- Load balancing (for multiple instances)

### Docker Optimization
- Multi-stage builds
- Layer caching
- Image size optimization
- Health checks

### Database Performance
- Connection pooling
- Index optimization
- Query performance monitoring
- Regular maintenance

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
- Application health checks
- Database connectivity monitoring
- SSL certificate expiration alerts
- Disk space monitoring

### Log Management
```bash
# View application logs
docker-compose logs -f nextjs-app

# View Nginx logs
docker-compose logs -f nginx

# System logs
journalctl -u docker
```

### Backup Strategy
- Database backups
- Application code backups
- SSL certificate backups
- Environment configuration backups

## üöÄ Deployment Workflows

### Initial Deployment
1. Server preparation and security setup
2. Docker and dependencies installation
3. Application deployment
4. SSL certificate configuration
5. DNS configuration and testing

### Updates and Maintenance
1. Pull latest changes
2. Build new Docker images
3. Deploy with zero downtime
4. Verify deployment health
5. Monitor for issues

### Rollback Procedures
1. Identify deployment issues
2. Stop current containers
3. Deploy previous stable version
4. Verify system stability
5. Investigate and fix issues
